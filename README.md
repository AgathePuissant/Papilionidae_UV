# UV wing pattern diversification in Papilionidae

This repository contains the R code to run statistical analysis on phenotypic coordinates of UV wing colour pattern of 80 Papilionidae species.

The file "brightness.R" runs the phylogenetically paired t-test to test for difference in average UV brightness among males and females and ventral and dorsal sides.

The file "dorso_ventral.R" runs the comparison of evolutionary rates between dorsal and ventral sides for UV coordinates and visible-light coordinates, and the PGLS between dorso-ventral distance in the UV and in visible light.

The file "sisterspecies_sympatry_divergence.R" runs the generalized linear model to test for divergence in UV coordinates for closely related sister species.
